# Home Automation Systems

This is a project reconfigured and improved from my late projects in Control Systems and Microprocessor.



## Features for a classic home automation

- Use of IR (Infrared Sensors) to control electronic devices
- Fans for Living Room and Kitchen can be turned ON and OFF 
- Lights for Living Room and Kitchen can be turned ON and OFF
- Door Lock that can be switched ON and OFF
- Power Management

## Features for an advanced home automation

- Electronic Devices are automatically controlled by the sensors
- Fans for Living Room can be controlled when sensor detects a user within the area
- Lights for Living Room and Kitchen can be turned ON and OFF automatically by a photosensor/photoresistor. If light is detected turn OFF, if no daylight is detected turn ON
- Use of Ultrasonic Sensor to lock and unlock door
- Power Management no longer needed. Devices automatically turns off when not in use
- Fire Alarm Detector additional feature for emergency
